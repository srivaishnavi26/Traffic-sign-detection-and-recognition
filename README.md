# Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition with Open-Set Rejection and Temporal Consensus

This repository contains the implementation of our final year B.Tech project focused on real-time traffic sign recognition in unconstrained road environments.

## Key Features
- Real-time traffic sign detection
- Fine-grained classification
- Open-set rejection for fake/non-traffic signs
- Temporal consensus using tracking across video frames

## Datasets
- GTSRB (Classification)
- GTSDB (Detection)
- Custom fake-sign dataset (billboards, shop signs, branding)
- Road videos from open sources (Pixabay, Mixkit)

## Status
🚧 Project under active development (Phase-1: Data preparation)

## Team
B.Tech CSE (Data Science)  
Srinivasa Ramanujan Institute of Technology
